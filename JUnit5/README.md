# Getting Started with JUnit5: The Ultimate Guide

## Introduction:

JUnit5 is a powerful testing framework for Java, designed to make writing and running tests easier and more effective. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, JUnit5 is an indispensable tool in your testing arsenal. In this article, we'll explore the key features of JUnit5, its differences from older versions, its modules, and the annotations you can use to write effective tests.

## Key Features of JUnit5:
JUnit5 comes with several key features that make it stand out:

+ Improved architecture: JUnit5 introduces a new architecture that is more modular and extensible than its predecessors. This allows developers to easily extend and customize the framework to suit their needs.

+ Support for modern Java features: JUnit5 fully supports the latest features of Java, including lambda expressions and streams. This makes writing tests more concise and expressive.

+ Enhanced assertion capabilities: JUnit5 includes a rich set of assertion methods that make it easy to verify the behavior of your code. These assertions are more flexible and powerful than those provided by older versions of JUnit.

+ Flexible test parameterization: JUnit5 allows you to parameterize your tests using various sources, such as CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, or custom providers. This makes it easy to run the same test with different inputs and verify its behavior under different conditions.

## Differences from Older Versions:
JUnit5 introduces several significant differences from older versions, including:

+ Improved support for parameterized tests: JUnit5 provides better support for parameterized tests, allowing you to easily define multiple sets of input parameters and run the same test with each set.

+ New extension model: JUnit5 introduces a new extension model that allows you to extend and customize the behavior of the framework using annotations and interfaces. This provides more flexibility and makes it easier to integrate JUnit5 with other testing frameworks and tools.

+ Removed features: JUnit5 removes some features that were present in older versions, such as the @RunWith annotation and the ability to extend test classes with custom runners. Instead, JUnit5 encourages the use of extensions and decorators to achieve similar functionality in a more flexible and modular way.

+ About the differences from JUnit4
    - In JUnit4 a single jar library contains the entire framework. We need to import the whole library, even when we only require a particular feature. but in JUnit 5, we get more granularity and can import only whatâ€™s necessary.
    - Only one test runner can execute tests at a time in JUnit 4 (e.g. SpringJUnit4ClassRunner or Parameterized ). JUnit 5 allows multiple runners to work simultaneously.
    - JUnit 4 never advanced beyond Java 7, missing out on a lot of features from Java 8. JUnit5 makes good use of the Java 8 features.
    - The idea behind JUnit5 was to completely rewrite JUnit 4 in order to negate most of these drawbacks.

## JUnit5 Modules:
JUnit5 is organized into several modules, each of which provides different functionality:

+ **JUnit Jupiter**:
    - JUnit Jupiter is the new programming model in JUnit 5.
    - It provides annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll` ... for writing tests.
    - Jupiter allows the use of lambda expressions and method references in test cases.
    - It supports parameterized tests using the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation.
    - JUnit Jupiter encourages the use of extensions for additional functionality, such as mocking, parameter resolution, and custom test annotations.

+ **JUnit Platform**:
    - JUnit Platform is the foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
    - It defines the TestEngine API for discovering and executing tests and also provides a Console Launcher for running tests from the command line.
    - The platform supports multiple programming models, including JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5), JUnit 4, and potentially others in the future.
    - JUnit Platform allows for the creation of custom testing engines, enabling support for other testing frameworks to run on the platform.

+ **JUnit Vintage**:
    - JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine implementation for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests on the JUnit Platform.
    - It allows existing JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 tests to be executed alongside JUnit 5 tests.
    - Vintage allows gradual migration from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 by enabling both frameworks to coexist in the same project.
    - This module is mainly for `backward compatibility` and is not meant for writing new tests but for running existing ones written in older versions of JUnit.

+ **Other modules**: JUnit5 also includes several other modules for specific purposes, such as test parameterization, mocking, and integration with popular IDEs and build tools.

## Annotations in JUnit5:
JUnit5 provides a rich set of annotations that you can use to write tests and customize their behavior:

+ ***Mark a method as a test method that should be executed by the test runner***
```bash 
    ![#c5f015]@Test
```

+ *** ***
```bash 
    
```
